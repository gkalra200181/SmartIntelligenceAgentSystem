Priya (PM): Today we’re planning tasks for Sprint 14. We need to address user reports around slow load times.

Daniel (Engineer): I found that the bottleneck is our outdated caching layer. I can rewrite it, but it’ll take 4 days.

Priya: Let’s prioritize this for the sprint. Daniel, please proceed.

Liam (Engineer): We should also fix the notifications bug. Users are getting duplicate alerts.

Priya: Good point. Liam, take the lead on that and finish it by Thursday.

Nora (Designer): I’m working on the new dashboard layout, but I need input on analytics requirements.

Priya: I’ll schedule a call with Data Science tomorrow.

Data Scientist: Sure, I’ll join and send initial metric definitions before the call.

QA Lead: Last sprint we had delays due to unclear acceptance criteria. Can we document them early this time?

Priya: Agreed. I’ll write detailed acceptance criteria for all tasks by end of day.

Support Lead: We’re seeing repeated tickets on password reset issues. Could Engineering investigate?

Daniel: I’ll take a look after the caching rewrite.
