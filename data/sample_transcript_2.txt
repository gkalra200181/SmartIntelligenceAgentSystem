Sarah (Designer): Thanks for joining the design review. I’ve updated the onboarding flow visuals based on last week’s feedback.

Jason (PM): Looks good. The team wants fewer steps during the sign-up process. Can we combine the last two screens?

Sarah: Yes, I can merge them. I need copy guidance from Marketing before I finalize.

Emily (Marketing): I’ll provide new copy drafts by tomorrow afternoon.

Alex (Engineer): Once Sarah updates the designs, I can begin implementing the final UI. Implementation will take about 3 days.

Jason (PM): Perfect. Let’s aim for having the final UI in staging by next Tuesday.

QA Lead: I’ll prepare test cases this week and be ready to test as soon as staging is updated.

Jason: Also, we need a decision on the welcome animation. Should we keep it or remove it?

Sarah: I suggest we keep it but simplify the motion.

Alex: Works for me.

Jason: Okay. Sarah, can you provide a simplified animation version?

Sarah: Yes, I’ll do that by Friday.
